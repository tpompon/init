awk -F ':' '{print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd | column -t

# Before making the script, you need to understand the different parts
# of the file "/etc/passwd"

# I used awk to take only the fields I wanted (1 (login), 3 (UID), 6 (Path))
# ':' is the delimiter, you can see the original file with : cat /etc/passwd
